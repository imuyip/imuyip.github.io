### Piyumi Athulathmudali - Blog intro

I don't know how you found it, but welcome to my blog!

One side of this blog is mostly about data - data visualisation in particular. I'll post my takes on 'Makeover Monday' challenges (a brilliant community of people improving their data visualisation skills by doing-over existing ones), walkthroughs of how I created some data visualisations, any interesting data I come across.

I also like to post about my hobbies and other life pursuits - permaculture projects with my partner, vegan cookery, and various other crafts projects including experiments with natural dyes, wood carving, turning Forest the dog's floof into threads... you get the idea.
